## How does it work?
This visualization makes use of the "Chamberlain" Game Engine. With the engine, a series of cells is draw to the screen. Each cell has a state of being blocked or unblocked. This information is then fed into the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) which finds the best optimal path between two points.

## How to start
* Download the .jar file in /Version-1/
